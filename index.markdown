Hi! Iâ€™m Martin Stuebler.

I founded BioFluff, a sustainable fashion material company that came to change the world of sustainable plush.

In 2021, that meant plant-based fibers and new manufacturing methods.

I'm now back to building, exploring compliance, sustainability and AI.

Outside of work, I love tea, yoga, and the occasional aquarell painting. Ask me about my first internship as a goat shepherd in the mountains of Andalucia, or why I joined a San Francisco Startup developing mushroom leather, or my travels chasing all of the above.
