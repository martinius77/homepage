## In this context I'm passionate about capturing the moods of the places I have visited.  

When studying at Cornell University in 2017, my room-mate was a famous Chinese watercolor artist. Night after night I kept watching him paint until I could no longer resist the urge to paint myself — and it changed my life.  

The first stroke of a fully loaded brush over cold pressed paper always opens up a space of unprecedented possibility and utter powerlessness. Watercolor has taught me a fascination for wild things and a deep   understanding that they fade especially when you grasp them too firmly.

To me, taking a photo is the first glimpse of discovering the underlying essence of a scene, You can see some of my photographic inspiration on my Photography page. Photography and painting are two related actions, but the latter uses even more reductive, selective and affirmative methods.

I’m always trying to capture the mood of a place, the feeling that this particular view evokes in me. Sometimes a place has a particularly strong presence that I’m trying to mix into my painting. Other places are rich in personal memories but all of them have one thing in common, they possess a natural beauty that goes beyond what a Photo can show. That’s why I’m painting.

This deserted island  see the individual aspects of it with the artists eyes. Sometimes it is deadly for a painting to overanalyze it, but I will try my best to highlight only the key aspects and leave the rest of the interpretation to the observer who will probably see much more then I can put into words.

When I grew up this we the place I considered my kingdom, a sleepy field and a silent forest separated by a brook. When I came home from school nothing could stop me from throwing off all the pressure of the day by throwing my schoolbag into the corner and running with my pocket knife and a small spool of yarn up and away. The slightly purplish sky is representing a children’s memories.

I still remember very well when I first arrived in this beautiful city. Actually it was a very dirt and cold city that I arrived in. Coming from the country side the move into capital was shock and the shared room, lack of money and friends did not make it easier. BOKU University became my new home, the show gardens and dark corridors my living room.

One morning after a long night of studying I witnessed the early morning sun break though the thick layer of low hanging clouds and I realized, that Vienna is not a beautiful city for it’s building but for the peoples hearts. The high contract in the sky is showing the drastic change of brightness that the eye is still trying to adopt to,

Berkeley Marina was my preferred running route in 2029 when I moved to the Bay Area to join a Biomaterials startup.

Broadway
It felt like being in the heart of this planet pulsing through it’s very veins when I first arrived in New York. Sleeping at a grey out station being cheated by the first person I asked for directions and helped by the second person I realized that this place was playing on a different level. Walking down broadway became my unprecedented pleasures whenever I had time to spare. The warm tones used for the architecture in the background indicates that I had wonderful people around me that made this place memorable.

There is no circus like the circus of Barcelona, an old song goes.
