### Personal logbook and diary of my writing odyssey as an engineer.  

Committing for one month to one short lesson per day—I told myself—will make you a better writer, attentive reader, and more successful communicator.  

Each post is a short excerpt, please find the full source attached.

## Day 1

–Don't overuse adverbs

2 min read

 [ Article source ](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/30-grammar-mistakes-writers-should-avoid/)## Adverbs (words often ending in –ly), and in particular "really" and "very" are overused and tend to weaken the meaning and integrity of your sentences.   

Second language writers (or even worse, Engineers) are usually using too many adverbs indicating a lack of active verb vocabulary.  
Replacing adverbs by stronger and more concise verbs will help you write shorter sentences while painting a more vivid picture for the reader.  

Incorrect: After a very short introduction...  
Correct: After a brief introduction...  

Incorrect: The girl ran really fast.  
Correct: The girl sprinted.  

Incorrect: Her face was very pale.  
Correct: Her face was ashen.  

Incorrect: The algorithm is very simple.  
Correct: The algorithm is basic.  

Incorrect: Overuse of adverts can really dilute your writing.  
Correct: Overuse of adverbs can clutter your writing.

## Day 2

The serial (or Oxford) comma

3 min read

 [ Article source ](https://www.instructionalsolutions.com/blog/oxford-comma)## As engineers we are well accustomed to listing items. I would find listing items very satisfying, because I knew that I had a good chance of avoiding grammar mistakes. Little did I know that already a simple list like "nuts, washers, and screws" would require already an Oxford comma in a business writing context.  


<u>Convention</u>: A serial comma is the optional comma at the end of a list of three or more items.  


<u>Some facts about the serial or Oxford comma:  
</u>- Academia and business consistently uses serial comma.  
- Customary convention in journalism is to omit it.  
- Americans tend to use the serial comma more often than British.  
- There is no right or wrong for serial comma but consistency is key  


Let's assume that you are throwing a party inviting:   
strippers, John and Charlie  
You will probably end up with two male strippers named John and Charlie.  
Where as if you are throwing the same party with a serial comma:  
strippers, John, and Charlie  
You will and up with at least two strippers and two other guests called John and Charlie.   
That's why throwing parties with a serial comma is much more fun.  

Over the holidays I'll probably go home and see  
"My mother, my mentor, and biggest critic"  
Hence I'm going to meet at least three people including my Mum one of my mentors and one of my biggest critics.  
But if we using a serial comma here  
"My mother, mentor and biggest critic"  
I'll meet my Mum who is also my mentor and biggest critic.  


Recommendation:  
<u>Use the serial comma consistently in your business writing.</u>

## Day 3

then for time, than for comparison

2 min read

 [ Article source ](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/when-to-use-then-and-than)## For most of you this might seem like a simplified chapter of a primary school textbook. Choosing the wrong word with unprecedented accuracy—I relied completely on autocorrect to deal with these two words.   

My biggest problem as a kid was that the two words produced a similar sound so when I had to study them in school I was probably storing this information in a remote area of my brain labeled as "nitty-gritty educational ballast". Anyway—I was not planning on using English ever again, luckily this conviction has died a traitors death.  

<u>1. Then is an adverb that indicates time.  
</u>"I was younger then."  
"I lived in Austria then."  
"You will have to wait until then."  
"If you are so busy, then leave."  
"Hike then jump into the lake."  
"You're certain then?"  

<u>2. Than is used in comparison of objects.  
</u>"You are younger than I am."  
"She is taller than you."  
"Time is more important than money."  
"We have less space than you."  
"Paul is taller than Maria.""China is growing faster than Europe."

## Day 4

lay, lie, and laid

2 min read

 [ Article source ](https://www.britannica.com/story/lay-lie-lied-lain-when-do-we-use-which)## When relying on autocorrect for your writing—something I have done for years—it is difficult to avoid mistakes with lay and lie.  

**Lay-&gt; put  
Lie-&gt; rest**  

<u>Present tense:  
</u>Lay: Please **lay** the book on my desk. (put the book on my desk)  
Lie: You should better **lie** down. (rest in a horizontal position)  

<u>Past tense:  
</u>Lay: He **laid** the plates no the counter. (put the plates)  
Lie: I felt sick, so I **lay** down. (rested in a horizontal position)  

<u>Present participle:  
</u>Lay: She was **laying** the flowers on the table (placed the flowers)  
Lie: We have been **lying** down all day (have been resting)  


<u>Grammar hack:</u>Try to speak it out loud, the sound of the word "lay" will sound similar to "place" or "place something" and is therefore equivalent to "put".

## Day 5

hyphens, En-dash and Em-dashes

3 min read

 [ Article source ](https://getitwriteonline.com/articles/en-dashes-em-dashes/)## In my earliest scientific writing I have only used hyphen—and I would call it "minus". I would use it for everything from joining words, numbers to listing items or creating a text break.  

A comparison of the three most common horizontal lines: - – — will give us meaningful insights into their different meaning and use.  

1. Hyphen - Mac: "minus key"   
2. En-dash – Mac: "option key" + "minus key"  
3. Em-dash — Mac: "shift key" + "option key" + "minus key"  
4. Underscore \_ Mac: "shift key" + "minus key"  

1. The hyphen is the shortest and the one I previously called "minus" it's used to create compound adjectives (high-tech, well-being, life-size, state-of-the-art and off-campus) or to tell the age of things (two-year-old) or for all compound numbers (twenty-one)  

2. The En-dash, is slightly longer than the hyphen and shorter than the Em-dash it's used to join numbers ( 2–3 pages, 2017–2019 period, 3:45–4:15 meeting, 25–35 people) Do not space before and after the En-dash.  

3. The Em-dash, is the longest of the three and commonly used to show a break in thought. ( No-one—not even here mother—realized the change) Do not space before and after the Em-dash.  

4. The underscore—originally used on analog typewriters to underline text—has no direct application in English writing. Some applications include Email-addresses, URL's and document naming nomenclatures all of which are dating back from a time when computer programs had troubles processing blank space between words.

## Day 6

–Avoid too many prepositional phrases

2 min read

 [ Article source ](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/30-grammar-mistakes-writers-should-avoid/)## Try to avoid too many prepositional phrases in a single sentence, they can obscure the main subject and action of a sentence. Whenever possible, simplify.  

–**Complicated**: The opinion of the manager.  
–**Simple**: The manager's opinion.  
Use prepositions instead of prepositional phrases.  

–**Complicated**: The caravan came over the top of the mountain.  
–**Simple**: The caravan crested the mountain.  
The first sentence contains two prepositional phrases—"over the top" and "of the mountain" both of which can be avoided with a better word choice.  

–**Complicated**: The obvious effect of such a range of references in his talk is to assure the audience that the author is intelligent.   
–**Simple**: The wide ranging references in his talk assures the audience of the author's intellect.  

–**Complicated**: It is a matter of the gravest possible importance to the health of anyone with a history of a problem with disease of the heart that he or she should avoid the sort of food with a high percentage of saturated fats.  
–**Simple**: Anyone with a history of heart disease should avoid saturated fats.  

<u>Grammar hack:  
</u>Clear and concise sentences can be yelled by a boat's captain. If he can't shout your sentence over the roaring thunder and against the howling wind it's not a clear and concise sentence.

## Day 7

The SEMICOLON

–Do not join independent sentences with a comma

 1 min read

 [ Article source ](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/William-Jr-Strunk/dp/0205313426/ref=sr_1_2?adgrpid=81806099173&dchild=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-8yT_cbJ7QIV1ZrVCh0-pQDQEAAYASAAEgIsjfD_BwE&hvadid=394592758713&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9047033&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=b&hvrand=9029229851469937632&hvtargid=kwd-10252792&hydadcr=23344_1933399&keywords=elements+of+style&qid=1607814294&sr=8-2&tag=googdemozdesk-21)## The semicolon has more power to separate than the colon and the comma, and it is more formal than the dash.  
The semicolon is therefore the instrument of choice when joining two independent sentences. The semicolon is a simple method of indicating relationship between statements is one of the most useful devices in composition.   


<u>The relationship, as below, is commonly one of cause and consequence.</u>  
–It is nearly half past ten; we cannot reach the summit before noon.  
–Emilia's works are entertaining; they are full of appealing ideas.  

<u>It is, of course, equally correct to write them separately.</u>  
–It is nearly half past ten. We cannot reach the summit before noon.  
–Emilia's works are entertaining. They are full of appealing ideas.  

<u>If a junction is inserted use a comma.</u>  
–It is nearly half past ten, and we cannot reach the summit before noon.  
–Emilia's works are entertaining, for they are full of appealing ideas.  


The comparison of the three versions given above will show clearly the advantage of the semicolon. It suggest the relationship between the two statements better than version two while being shorter than the third form.

## Day 8

"What" is for lots of possibilities

"Which" is for less possibilities

3 min read

 [ Article source ](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/when-to-use-its-vs-its)## When it comes to "What" and "Which" I was deeply convinced that they could be used interchangeably. Well little did I know that this is usually the exception.  

<u>1. Infinite vs finite options to choose from:  
</u>Both words are interrogative pronouns used to ask a question. The key difference is the number of options and your knowledge about the subject asked. If you are asking a general or open ended question you are using "What". On the other hand if you have some options to choose from you are usually using "Which".  

**"What" is used for lot's of possibilities and when you don't know how many possibilities there are.**  
"What should we study tomorrow?"  
"What makes someone a good friend?"  
"What can we do to stop her?"  
"Do you know what time it is?"   

**"Which" is used when asking about a few options and when the options are known.**  
"Which wrist did you strain?"  
"Which of your paintings is your favorites?"  
"Which one is my fork?"  
"Which way should we go?"  

<u>2. Background knowledge:  
</u>**Choosing "Which" implies you know something already.** Asking someone for example about their nationality.  
What's your nationality: Implies I don't know where you are from.  
Which is your nationality: Suggests that you have for example narrowed it down to two choices and are awaiting a confirmation of one or the other.  

<u>Grammar hack:  
</u>"Which" can be combined with "of your" or "of" to check if the sentence sounds right.   
"Which (of your) pair of shoes are you going to wear tonight?"  
"What (of your) pair of shoes" does not sound right and is therefore not possible.

## Day 9

Enclosed parenthetic expressions between commas

2 min read

 [ Article source ](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/30-grammar-mistakes-writers-should-avoid/)## parenthetic = something enclosed by commas  

<u>Abbreviations should be enclosed accordingly.  
</u>Samples, organic waste, etc., should go here  
Max Musterman, Ph.D.,strongly objected.  

<u>Dates can be written with and without commas</u>  
January 1, 2020  
September, 11th, 1990  
9 July 2019  

<u>Titles and names in direct addresses is parenthetic  
</u>If, Madam, you refuse, I can not guarantee for your safety.  
Well, Martin, look where this got you.  

<u>No comma should separate a noun from it's identification  
</u>Alexander the Great  
The novelist Aldous Huxley   
The poet Cicero   

<u>Restrictive clauses: can't be split in two statements  
Non restrictive clauses: check by asking "who, which, when, where"</u>  

–People who live in glasshouses shouldn't throw stones. (**restrictive**)  

–Andrea, being too tired, moved forward.   
(**non restrictive**)  

–My friend Klaus is a talented gardener.   
(**restrictive**)  

–His younger brother, Clemens, plays football.   
(**non restrictive**)  

–Anthony, the friendly neighbor, helped her.   
(**non restrictive**)  

–Right there, in this office, his life changed forever.   
(**non restrictive**)  

–People sitting in the rear couldn't hear.   
(**restrictive**)

## Day 10

Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's

2 min read — "The elements of style, 4th edition"

**Possessive pronouns have no apostrophe they are already showing possession.**  
-his, -hers, -its, -yours, -ours, -theirs  

For all other nouns create the possessive singular by adding 's.  
-Klaus's garden  
-the bird's prey  
-next week's meeting  
-know one's rights  
-someone else's problem  

We can also distinguish possessive singulars and plurals by putting the apostrophe before and after the "s".   
-the cow's long horn (one cow's horn is long)  
-the cows' long horns (here we are talking about many cows)  

Exceptions are ancient names ending in -es and -is.  
-the temple of Hades  
-the crook of Osiris

## Day 11

-It's when part of a word has been removed

-Its: is a possessive

1 min read

 [ Article source ](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/when-to-use-its-vs-its)## I am not going bother you with another story of me misusing this one in about every situation possible. It's actually pretty simple and many native English speakers are actually surprised how you can get confused with it.   

<u>Use the apostrophe after "it" only if a word has been removed.  
</u>"It's a sunny day." — it is  
"It's been a while since..." — it has  
"It's been a pleasure." — it has  

<u>Its is used as a possessive.  
</u>"Its surface showed deep bullet holes.""Its tail between its legs.""Its very first try was a success."  

Maybe it helps you to remember that 's is only used when a word is removed, in any other case "its" should be used to indicate a possession.

## Day 12

-grammatical tautologies

2 min read — find full [Source](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/when-to-use-its-vs-its) here

**In grammatical terms a tautology is the repetition of the <u>s</u>ame idea using different words. While a tautology can be used to put emphasis on a particular statement it is often cluttering your sentence.**   

–Incorrect: I made this with my own hands for you.  
–Correct: I made this for you.  
The word "made" implies already that I did it "with my own hands" creating a redundancy.  

–Incorrect: It was adequate enough.  
–Correct: It was adequate.  
This tautology is not adding additional value to the reader as "adequate" and "enough" convey the same meaning.  

–Incorrect: In front of a large crowd.  
–Correct: In front of a crowd.   
At this point it is worth mentioning that there is no such word as "infront", as a complex preposition it can not be written in one word.  

–Incorrect: her added bonus  
–Correct: her bonus  
A bonus is usually added, so this is a grammatical tautology. The problem can be resolved by simplification (as demonstrated above) or by specification e.g. –her large bonus –her deserved bonus.  


<u>Tautological examples, there is no need to use both:  
</u>–over-exaggerates  
–close proximity  
-dry desert  
–new innovation  
–see her personally  
–close proximity  
–dilapidated ruins  
–evening sunset  
–frozen ice  
–3 p.m. in the afternoon  
–summit at the top  
–take turns, one after the other  
–sad misfortune  


A logical tautology is something slightly different and describes a statement that is always true:  

–Either it will rain tomorrow, or it won't rain.

## Day 13

–the colon

1 min read — see full [Source](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/when-to-use-its-vs-its) here

**The colon has more power to separate than the comma, less power than the semicolon, and it is more formal than the dash.**  

<u>A colon has certain functions of form.</u>  
Arrival at 15:50  
Dear Mr. President:  
Gardening: A beginners guide  
We need: hammer, chisel, and bolt cutter  

<u>The colon is used to join two independent clauses where the second emphasized the first.</u>We tried to reach the base camp that day but couldn't: there was no end of the storm in sight, wispy clouds soaring by, disappearing in the darkness.  
<u>A quotation can be introduced by colon if it supports the preceding clause.   
</u>The despair reminded her of a line from Winston Churchill: "We make a living by what we get, but we live by what we give."

## Day 14

this and that

5 min read — see full [Source](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/when-to-use-its-vs-its) here

**This, that, these, and those**  
Telling the difference between these words might seem easy to native, but for many second language speakers it can get really tricky when to use them.  

First distinction:  
**Singular**: this and that  
**Plural**: these and those  



Follow these three rules when indecisive about using this, that, these, and those. It has to do with the items you are describing.  


**<u>1. Rule: distance and time</u>** If the object you are addressing is close to you, use "this".  
If you are addressing more than one object close to you, use "these".  
On the other hand when an event happened to you recently use "this"; when several events happened to use use "these"  

–**This** day was beautiful.  
–He will drop you at **this** stop.  
–Did you make **these** pastries.  
–**These** dogs are very well behaved.  

When at least one object or event is far away from you use "that" and "those"  

–**That** factory in China is enormous.  
–**That** trial was 10 years ago.  
–Let's go to **that** famous sushi restaurant.  
–Are you going to buy **those** sunglasses.  
–**Those** boys over there are talking about you.  


<u>**2. Rule: Introducing and identifying people** </u>When introducing yourself or someone else you usually use "this", or "these" when it's more than one person.  

–Hello, **this** is Martin speaking. (on the telephone)  
–Mum, **this** is my boyfriend, Maximilian. (direct person to person)  
–**These**, are my teammates John, Dani, and Xavi. (introduction)  

That and those would be used when talking to someone about another person.   

–Do you know **those** kids?  
–**Those** are the friends that helped me yesterday.  
–**That** tree there was already here 400 years ago.  


**<u>3. Rule: Separating items or groups  
</u>**Use "this" and "that" in this order when comparing objects; use these and those when comparing groups or sets of items.  

–This car belongs to my sister. That one is mine.  
–I have already read **this** book. Let's read **that** one  
–**These** cookies are stale, but **those** are still good.  
–Are **these** your cloths, or **those**?  


<u>4. Rule: Demonstrative nouns  
</u>This, that, these, and those can also function as demonstrative pronouns. Like other pronouns, demonstrative pronouns stand in your nouns. They demonstrate which item the speaker is talking about.  

–The perfume you are spraying smells nice.  
–**This** smells nice.  

–The day I got accepted by my school was the best day of my life.  
–**That** was the best day of my life.  

–I wouldn't eat the cookies, they have been sitting on the table for 2 weeks.  
–I wouldn't eat **those**.  

–Hand the books in my hand to Silvia, please.  
–Hand **these** to Silvia, please.  


**<u>5. Rule: Demonstrative adjectives  
</u>**Adjectives are words used to describe or modify nouns (fast, smart, small). While demonstrative nouns replace a noun or an entire noun phrase, demonstrative adjectives come before the noun. This can be used when removing the entire noun phrase could create confusion.  

<u>Standard</u>: I love the idea of going hiking with you.  
<u>Demonstrative pronouns:</u> I love that.  
<u>Demonstrative adjectives:</u> I love that idea.  
The second version is grammatically correct but can be hard to understand. Using a demonstrative adjective makes the sentence more concise and easy to understand.  

More examples:–**This** salad tastes really good.  
–I would like to buy **that** jacket.  
<font size="4">–Did you bring **those** chocolate cookies last </font>Christmas<font size="4">?</font>–All **these** scars are from my skin accident.   


<u>Grammar hack:  
</u>Use this, that, these, and those to   
1) refer to things closer or further away  
2) differentiate things and compare items  
3) introduce someone or something  
4) replace pronouns  
5) replace adjectives  


## Day 15

–The number of the subjects determines the number of the verbs.

5 min read — see full [Source](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/when-to-use-its-vs-its) here

**Words that intervene between the subject and the verb do not impact the number of the verbs. Signal verbs such as "either", "one of", "none", and "and" help us to choose the right form.**  

<u>**SINGULAR**</u>  
<u>After each, either, neither, everyone, someone, nobody, "no one", "not one" use a singular</u>  
–Everybody thinks he **has** a unique approach.  
–Although both boys printed to the classroom, neither **was** there on time.  
–None of us **is** perfect.  

<u>A singular subject remains singular even if other nouns are connected to it by: except, with, in addition, together with, no less than or as well as.</u>  
–Her attire as well as her manner **is** objectionable.  
–What is wanted **is** a few more pairs of watchful eyes.  
–The trouble with viruses **is** it's many varieties.   

<u>Some nouns that appear to be plural are usually construed as singular.</u>  
–Politics **is** an art, not a science.  
–The company headquarters **is** on this side of the lake.  
–The contents of this book **is** essential for the exam.  

<u>Certain compound phrases are considered so common that they are considered a unit and therefore take a single verb.</u>  
–Give and take is essential to a sustainable relationship.  
–Bread and cheese was all they served.  
–Every door, window, and ventilation shaft was barred with planks  


<u>**PLURAL**</u>  
<u>Use plural when "none" indicates more than one person.  
</u>–None **are** so fast as those who are running for a good cause.  

<u>Use plural in a relative clause when following "one of", or a similar expression when the relative is the subject.</u>  
–She is one of **those** people that are never ready on time.  

<u>A compound subject formed by two or more nouns joined by "and" almost always requirers a plural verb.</u>  
– Sasha and Shane **were** walking hand in hand.  



## Day 16

Pronouns can function as subject or object.

1 min read

**Pronouns (he, she, it and who) change their form when they function as subject or object.**  
<u>Always supply full context: </u>–Incorrect: My mum misses him even more **than I**.  
–Correct: My mum misses him even more **than I do**.  

–Incorrect: Peter loves his bike more **than me**.  
–Correct: Peter loves his bike more **than he loves me**.  

–Incorrect: A group of us workers protested.  
–Correct: A group of us protested as workers.  

<u>Keep it simple:</u>–Incorrect: Dave and **myself** stayed at home.  
–Correct: Dave and **I** stayed at home.  

–Incorrect: Sheila and **yourself** are on holiday, I thought.  
–Correct: Sheila and **you** are on holiday, I thought.  

<u>The difference between a verbal participle and a gerund is not always easy:</u>  

–Do you mind **me** asking a question?  
(do you mind if the question comes from me in particular?)  

–Do you mind **my** asking a question?  
(do you mind being asked in general?)

## Day 17

Contractions

3 min read

if you wanna learn more , here is the full [source](https://style.mla.org/ask-the-mla/contractions/)

**A contraction is a shortened form of a word, or a combination of words, that omits certain letters or sounds.**  

Can we use contractions in formal writing—YES absolutely  

Making prose more approachable, less stilted and overall easier to read are the main objectives when incorporating them into your writing style.  

Contractions may not be suitable for all forms of formal writing e.g. research papers or when writing to a judge.   
Clarity and context are key, if a contraction results in lack of clarity avoid it. e.g.   
–she'd can mean *she had* or *she would*.

if you wanna learn more , here is the full [source](https://grammar.collinsdictionary.com/easy-learning/the-subjunctive)

The subjunctive is used in formal writing or formal speech to express something **desired, anticipated** or **imagined**.The use of the subjunctive is more common in the American than in British English and nowadays only used, understood, and practiced by few people. Correctly applied it can give your writing style a tremendous boost.   

The subjunctive is required in colloquial writing for a few fixed expressions such as:  

–God **bless** you  
–God save the Queen!  
–God help us!  
–Long **live** the President!  
–If I **were** you, ...  



<u>**Base Subjunctive** </u>The subjunctive is used in subordinate clauses that follow verbs expressing a desire, a demand a formal recommendation, or a resolve.   

<u>There are two common structures for the Base Subjunctive:</u>  

**1. suggest-verb (or noun) + that**  
<u>examples:</u> order, request, suggest, demand, command, insist, order, propose, prefer, ask, advise  

**2. advisable-adjective + that**  
<u>examples:</u> crucial, best, desirable, essential, advisable, important, unthinkable, necessary, anxious, adamant, determined, eager, keen  


<u>Examples: Main clause + **suggestive**-verb (or noun)  
</u>–She suggests **that** you **be** promoted.  
–The consultant recommended **that** this devision **join** the company.  
–The board recommended that he not be dismissed.  
–She requested that the room not be locked at night.  
–They made a request that we **be** early.  
–We made a request that we not be disturbed.  
–She made a proposal that the company **buy** more shares back.  
–The president has issued an order, that the secretary resign.  

<u>Examples: Main clause + **advisable**-adjective  
</u>–It was advisable that she **rest** for a week.  
–It was essential that the army **advance** rapidly.  
–After the landing it will be vital, that every solder not **use** a radio  
–He is anxious that she **return** soon.  
–They are keen that he not **be** hurt.  
–We were determined that it **remain** secret.  

<u style="font-style: normal;">Some more examples for the Base Subjunctive:  
</u>–Heaven forbid **that** that should happen to me.  
–Suffice it to say he escaped unscathed.  
–If **that** be the case I intend to report.  
–The judges ordered **that** he **be** released.  
–It is important **that** the car **be** waiting when we arrive.  
–The manager was eager that he **see** the new product.  






<u>**Were subjunctive (If + were)** </u>In written English and in very formal speech, the past subjunctive **were** is sometimes used with the 1st and 3rd person singular, in place of the normal past form **was**.  
The past subjunctive may be used after **if** or **I wish**, to express regret or longing.  

<u>Structures for the Were-Subjunctive:</u>  

(If, as If, wish, suppose) + were +subjunctive  

<u>Some Examples of the Were-Subjunctive:</u>  
–I wish you **were** here.  
–I wish it **were** over.  
–I wish I **weren't** so slow  
–I wish the computer **were** working.  

–I'd check these numbers again if I were him.  
–I'd tell her if I were you.  
–I'd go if I were younger  
–I'd do this if I were you.  

–If I **were** younger I would go back.  
–If I **were** richer I would travel the world.  
–If he **were** not so mean, he would have friends.  
–If she **were** inside she could open the door.  

Many people prefer to use the normal form (**was** instead of **were**) of the past in this type of sentence.   
In ordinary English this is quite acceptable.  



> If this be error and upon me proved,  
> I never writ, nor no man ever loved.   
> William Shakespeare

> If I were a boy <cite style="color: #999999; font-size: medium; display: block; margin-top: 5px; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Beyoncé</cite>

## Day 19

Use the active voice

5 min read

if you wanna learn more , here is the full [source](https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/style/ccs_activevoice/)

**Try to use the active voice whenever possible. It usually leads to shorter, more meaningful and direct sentences and you can avoid an entanglement of prepositional phrases.**   
<u>**When to use to active and passive voice?** </u>  

Generally, in a sentence written in the active voice the subject performs the actions. In a sentence written in passive the subject is affected by the action.   
<u>**Compare the following examples to find the advantages of an active voice.**</u>  
–<u>Passive</u>: The first time I set foot on a sailboat shall always be remembered.–<u>**Active**</u>: I shall always remember the first time I set foot on a sailboat.  
–<u>Passive</u>: It is believed by the media that an offer should be placed by the CEO.  
–<u>**Active**</u>: The media believes that the CEO should place a counter offer.  

<u>–Passive:</u> It was earlier demonstrated that the signal rate can be correlated to brain activity.  
–<u>**Active**:</u> Researchers earlier showed that the signal rate correlates to brain activity.  

–<u>Passive</u>: The girl has been scratched by a cat.  
– <u>**Active**</u>: The cat scratched the girl.  


<u>**When to use the passive voice:** </u>  
– To emphasize the action rather than the actor:  
After long debate, the proposal was endorsed by the long range planning committee.  

– To tactful by not naming the actor:  
The procedures were somehow misinterpreted.  

– To describe a conditions where the actor is unknown or unimportant:  
Every year hounders are visiting this site on their pilgrimage.   

– To create an authoritative voice:  
Portfolios are not accepted after 18:00.  


<u>Grammar hack:  
</u>To detect passive sentences and convert them into active voice watch out for indicator words like "by" or vague subjects to identify passive sentences.

## Day 20

How to pronounce the

1 min read

 [see full post](https://www.englishclub.com/pronunciation/the.htm)

**The word the is usually pronounced short like "thuh" but when the comes before a vowel sound we pronounce it long as in "thee".**  

<u>Examples</u>  
the apples — <u>thee</u> **a**pple  
the clock — <u>thuh</u> clock  


"Thee" before a vowel sound  


| vowel sound | write | say |
|---|---|---|
| a | *the **a**pple* | thee apple |
| e | *the **e**gg* | thee egg |
| i | *the **i**ce-cream* | thee ice-cream |
| o | *the **o**range* | thee orange |
| u | *the **u**gli fruit* | thee ugli fruit |


It is important to understand that it is what we **say** that matters, not what we write. It is the **sound** that matters, not the letter at the beginning of the word. So we use a long "thee" before a **vowel sound**, not necessarily before a vowel.


Look at these cases:

| we write | with | we say | because |
|---|---|---|---|
| *the house* | consonant h | thuh **h**ouse | consonant sound |
| *the hour* | consonant h | thee **o**ur | vowel sound |
| *the university* | vowel u | thuh **y**ouniversity | consonant sound |
| *the umbrella* | vowel u | thee **u**mbrella | vowel sound |



<u>Use of the emphatic "thee"  
</u>The long pronounced form of the can also be used to pot emphasize on a certain statement.  

A: I saw the (thuh)Queen yesterday  
B: What! The (thee) Queen of the United Kingdom  
A: Yes, exactly!

when to use *I* or *Me*

2 min read

 [ Article source ](https://getitwriteonline.com/articles/i-and-me/)## When to use *I* or *me*  
A simple guide on how to choose the right pronoun.  

– Cristina and **I** will take the material to the meeting room.   
<u>Correct</u>: because Cristina and I are the subject of the verb *take.*  

– The winner of the context were Stilian and **I**.  
<u>Correct:</u> Because we can think of the linking verb *and* as a mathematical equation, hence we should be able to reverse the sentence and still have it make sense.  

– He called John and **me** on Monday.  
<u>Correct</u>: because called is an action verb, and "John and me" aren't direct objects. We can easily hear that if we remove "John and" from the sentence.  

– The argument was between Ana and **me**.  
<u>Correct</u>: because it serves as the object of the preposition *between*. As in every other case, removing the compound usually enables us to hear which pronoun is correct.  

– Andrew said, "Father gave the keys to Mitch and **me**."  
<u>Correct</u>: because *it* serves as the object of the preposition *to*. As in every other case, removing the compound usually enables us to hear which pronoun is correct.  

– When you leave please give the key to Amanda or **me**.   
<u>Correct</u>: because *give* is an action verb.  

– She asked if Klaus and **me** can find speakers for the presentation.   
<u style="font-style: normal;">Correct</u>: because *find* is an action verb.  
– They encouraged Mathew and **me** to join the club.   
<u>Correct</u>: because me serves as an object to the preposition.  

– The negotiations between the real estate agent and **me** lasted several months.   
<u>Correct</u>: because it serves as an object to the preposition.  

– And the nominees for this years charity ball dance are Miriam, Ashley, Peter, and **I**.  
<u>Correct</u>: because I is following a linking verb.  



<u>Grammar hack:  
</u>Simply removing the compound usually enables us to hear which pronoun is correct.

Latin abbreviations

2 min read

 [ Article source ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_abbreviations)## Latin as the root of many languages, is part of our every day life. Some latin terms have survived until today but were shortened to abbreviations. Examples range from birth certificates, academic degrees to tombstones, so you will never be worse off when knowing what they mean.   

List of common Latin abbreviations:  
**AD**: Anno Domini, "in the year of the lord" (e.g. AD 1990)  


If you want to avoid religious terms in your writing, or you're writing for an audience that doesn't use the BC/AD eras, then you can use “CE” instead. “CE” isn’t Latin either; it just means "Common Era." Similarly, you would use “BCE” to mean "Before the Common Er

**a.m.:** Ante Meridian, "before noon" ( e.g. 6 a.m.)  

**ca.**: Circus, "Approximately" ( e.g. ca. 15 cm)  

**Et al.**: Et alia, "and others" ( e.g. Stuebler et al.)  
You typically see "et al." in academic papers when the author is citing a book or article written by several people.   

**etc**.: Et cetera, "and other things" ( e.g. wall, floor etc.  
And finally, although dictionaries say you can use "et cetera" for things or people, some style guides, such as The Chicago Manual of Style, say that because the Latin word "cetera" refers to inanimate objects and non-living things, you shouldn't use "etc." to refer to people.  

**e.g**.: exempli grantia, "example" ( e.g. lions or leopards)  

**ff.**: floruit, "and following" ( e.g. page 45ff)   

**lb**: libra, "scales", indication for the pound weight ( e.g. 50 lb)  

**p.m.**: post meridiem, "after noon" ( e.g. 2 p.m.)  

**P.S.**: post script, "after what was written" ( e.g. P.S. I love you)  

**R.I.P.**: requiescat in pace, "Rest In Peace" (e.g. R.I.P. Joe)   

**Sic**. Sic erat scriptum, thus it was written ( e.g. citation \[sic\])  
"Sic" is usually used when you're citing text, and the cited work has mistakes in it, like grammar or spelling errors. You typically put "sic" in brackets to show that you recognize this was an error, and that it's not a mistake on your part.  

**Stat.**: Statim, "immediately" (e.g. I need some coffee stat)  

**S.O.S.**: Si Opus Sit "if there is need" (e.g. when requesting help)  

**vs.**: versus, "against" (e.g. SF 49ers vs. Rams)  


<u>Grammar hack:</u>   
Put some fancy latin abbreviations at the bottom of your next shopping list ( e.g. sic. = "thus it was written" or S.O.S = "if there is need" ) to make it sound a little epic and encourage your partner to get the best deal out there. ## Day 23

linking verbs

2 min read

 [ Article source ](https://chloeburroughs.com/sentence-structure/)##   
Many ways can lead to an improved sentence structure. From sticking to subject-verb-object structure to varying the length of each sentence to avoid boring your reader. In my personal writing none of them was as important as becoming best friend with "linking words"   

List of common linking verbs:   
<u>addition:</u>– in addition  
– Furthermore  
– Similarly  
– Also  
– Likewise  
– Moreove  

<u>for contrast:  
</u>– Nevertheless  
– Yet  
– But  
– On the other hand  
– Alternativley  
– Conversly  
– In contrast  

<u>For exemplifying:  
</u>– For example  
– To illustrate  
– For instance  
– To exemplify  

<u>For consequences:  
</u>– Thus  
– As a result  
– Therefore  
– Consequently  

<u>For summarizing:  
</u>– To conclude  
– To summarize  
– In conclusion  

<u>Grammar hack:</u>   
When writing, try and pay attention to how frequently you’re using linking words. If you notice you have to include these words between most of your sentences, you may be jumping between ideas too much. If this is the case, spend some time reorganising your thought so related ideas are processed together.
