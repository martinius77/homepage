Photography taught me three things
curiosity, composition, and patience
 — qualities very useful for painting.  

Painting taught me three more things
intensity, timing, and when to stop
 — qualities very important for life.  


 “…looking at, studying, and absorbing good photography serves the same purpose for a beginning photographer. That is because learning the components of a good image – composition, lighting, gesture – and seeing those elements used differently over and over by different masters, makes it easier for a person to achieve the same end on his or her own over time. And there is simply is no alternative to this, no shortcut.”
